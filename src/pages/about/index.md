### What is valmi.io?

valmi.io activation (reverse-ETL) is the open-source data activation platform to load data from warehouses into SaaS platforms, Webhook Apis etc.

### Technology

valmi.io uses some of the best tools to create an Open Source Activation (reverse ETL) Platform. It is built over the airbyte protocol. dbt is the centerpiece of our source connectors, and duckdb for metrics. We engineered our orchestrator over dagster, and dagster dovetails perfectly with our vision of being a multi-persona tool.

### Vision

We envision a world where a vibrant community of engineers develops around connectors - a world in which the power of the open-source platform draws on the collective mind to keep the fast-moving world of connectors functional and cost-effective.
